SG is a Stackelberg Security Game tournament software developed using Java 8 but will most likely also work for Java 7.

For instructions on the assignment please read SecurityGame.pdf

To build and execute this code you can do two things:
1. Use ant by simply typing the command "ant" (without quotes) in the command line (ant needs to be installed http://ant.apache.org/)
	If the output is too long ant will only show the first part of it.
	To manually run the compiled jar type "java -jar build/jar/SG.jar"
	To build the JavaDoc type "ant doc" which will automatically create it.
2. Import the code to your favorite IDE and execute it that way
